## Problem Statement: 
*AI-Powered Nutrition and Meal Planning Assistant*

Making healthy food choices can be challenging, especially when trying to understand nutritional value and plan balanced meals with available ingredients. Many consumers struggle with interpreting food labels, and existing solutions often prioritize price over health. While some tools provide basic dietary insights, they fail to offer a seamless way to connect ingredient selection with personalized meal planning. There is a need for a solution that helps individuals assess the nutritional value of food items and make informed decisions based on their health needs. Additionally, leveraging available ingredients to create healthy, well-balanced recipes remains an unmet challenge. The solution should simplify the shopping experience while encouraging healthier eating habits in a way that feels intuitive and accessible.
